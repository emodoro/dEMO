Title: Differential Expression and confidencial estimation for FC 
Description: dEMO method: This method allows testing Differential Expression
    Analysis, estimating Fold Change both its point estimation and its 
    Confidence Estimation. It is based on both counts data fit well 
    negative binomial distribution, and a normal approximation  This package
    also stores several functions which allows evaluating the performance 
    from different differential expression analysis methods between them.
